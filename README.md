An incomplete cross-platform mobile timeclock application that can be used on iPads and Android tablets, written in Flutter (Dart).

This program can track punches, allow managers to customize punch types available, capture identifiers compatible with a database, allow registration through a QR code, and was prepped to work with a companion web app for managers. However, this project eventually got scraped as priorities shifted for the company sponsoring the project.
